#### Extend Globally

```js
{
    extends: '@team23/eslint-config-team23-vue'
}
```

### Extending the .eslintrc.js

Simply add a `'rules'` key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

```js
{
    extends: '@team23/eslint-config-team23-vue'
    rules: {
        'vue/order-in-components': 'off'
    }
}
```

### Additional configuration

- If your project relies on internationalization, you may want to add [vue/no-bare-strings-in-template](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/no-bare-strings-in-template) to your config.
- It may be helpful to enable [vue/require-prop-comment](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/require-prop-comment) to document component interfaces.

## Development
